This web application is used to manage the projects/internships for final year students. 

It allows the students to submit their projects along with their respective synopsis to their allocated faculty guides which guides can grade them and give their reviews.

It also includes the weekly submission for reports from students. All the files are stored in an S3 bucket on AWS.

The admin can also add users individually or using a CSV which contains the users data in a Predefined format.

Admin can also generate the student info excel sheet which will contain all the information about the students along with their respective project.

Admin can also approve/reject projects based on their information as well as edit teams and generate marksheets for each project from the web-app automatically.
